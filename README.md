###This is only the planned structure of how this repository will be organised. I.e. For now files/directories may be empty for use in the future

##Table of Contents:

* Ingredients.txt			Where all ingredients will be compiled and stored

* Recipe_Book.txt			Where all recipes and ingredients are compiled and stored
	* [TAG]	Recipe_Book_Draft_1		All ingredients and recipes have been pushed
	* [TAG]	Recipe_Book_Draft_2		All ingredients and recipes have been pushed in an orderly fashion

	
* Recipe_Book_Drafts/		Here each recipe will be stored as a text draft, later to be compiled within Recipe_Book.txt

* Screenshots/			Screenshots of any merge conflicts should be stored	here

---

Sub-Teams later will be decided depending on the number of commits they have
performed. The 2 with the most commits will be assigned to work on the recipe
book of their choosing, and the other 2 members will work on the remaining 
recipe book.

Anyone objecting to this decision feel free to discuss it as an issue.
