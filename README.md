Sub-Teams later will be decided depending on the number of commits they have
performed. The 2 with the most commits will be assigned to work on the recipe
book of their choosing, and the other 2 members will work on the remaining 
recipe book.</p>

Anyone objecting to this decision feel free to discuss it as an issue.
