<Beef Fillet>


--------------------------------------------------------++

Ingredients

--------------------------------------------------------


900 g quality whole fillet of beef , trimmed

sea salt

freshly ground black pepper

2 handfuls fresh rosemary sprigs

1 bulb garlic , broken up, 
cloves left whole with skins on

extra virgin olive oil

1.2 kg Desirée or Maris Piper potatoes , peeled and sliced 0.5cm thick

3 heaped tablespoons creamed horseradish

½ bottle red wine

170 g butter


--------------------------------------------------------

Method

--------------------------------------------------------


1.	Generously season the beef fillet with salt and pepper. In a pestle and mortar bash up about a quarter of the rosemary with a clove of garlic to make a paste. Loosen with 5 tablespoons of olive oil and then rub this all over the beef. Tie the beef up with 4 pieces of string then poke the remaining rosemary sprigs under the string. This way the beef is almost protected by the herb during the cooking and it will also give great flavour.

2.	Preheat the oven to 250ºC/450ºF/gas 8. Parboil your sliced potatoes in boiling salted water for around 5 minutes. Drain in a colander, and transfer to a bowl with just enough olive oil to coat them. Season well. I like to make the potato cake in a round greased or non-stick cake tin, but you can use a non-stick frying pan with a metal handle if you have one. Or you can even make small individual ones. Place half the potatoes into the tin or pan, smearing the creamed horseradish over the top. Place the rest of the potatoes on top then pat down and put to one side.

3.	Brown off the beef in a snug-fitting roasting tray until all sides are coloured. Add the garlic cloves to the tray, place the beef on top of them and put in the oven with the potatoes on a shelf below. Cook for 20 minutes, then turn the beef over, baste it and add the red wine and butter to the tray. Remove the potato dish then carefully place a clean tea towel over it and push down to compact the spuds into a nice tight cake. Put the potatoes back into the oven for another 15–20 minutes.

4.	I serve the beef cooked medium, but you can cook it more or less to your preference. Remove the beef from the oven and while it is resting continue browning the potato cake for 5 minutes if it needs it. When you're ready to serve, remove the string and the rosemary sprigs from the beef and carve it into nice slices.

5.	Turn the potato cake out on to a board, or just scoop it out of the pan with a spoon if it's stuck and divide between your 6 serving plates beside the meat. Save any juices from the rested meat and return them to the tray, where the red wine and butter and all the goodness from the meat will have made a very simple but tasty cooking sauce. Finish by mushing up the garlic cloves, then pass the sauce through a sieve on to the meat. Lovely served with some dressed watercress.

6.	Try this: You could do the same recipe with a pork loin or venison.

<Fettucine Al Fredo>


--------------------------------------------------------++

Ingredients

--------------------------------------------------------


24 ounces dry fettuccini pasta

1 cup butter

3/4 pint heavy cream

salt and pepper to taste

1 dash garlic salt

3/4 cup grated Romano cheese

1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese


--------------------------------------------------------

Method

--------------------------------------------------------


1) Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain

2) In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; 
   this will thicken the sauce.
   

3) Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.

<Pizza Norma>


--------------------------------------------------------++

Ingredients

--------------------------------------------------------


For the dough: 

1 kg strong white bread flour

25 gr brewer's yeast 
1 tablespoon sugar

4-5 table spoon of e.v. olive oil

600 ml lukewarm water

20 gr salt



For the pizza: 

tomato sauce

few  leaves of fresh basil

mozzarella cheese

1 fried aubergine / eggplant

a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese


--------------------------------------------------------
Method

--------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	On your kitchen surface mix the flour with the salt and make a well in the middle.


2.	In a jug mix the yeast with "some" of the warm water and the sugar, whisk it using a fork and leave it there for few minutes. 


3.	Pour it into the well.


4.	Add the oil of olive and start kneading until you have a smooth, elastic and compact dough


5.	Keep adding the remaining water, little by little, letting absorbe it and give it the shape of a ball. 


6.	Place the ball in a large bowl dusted with flour at the bottom, cover it with a cloth and let it rise in a warm place, far from airstreams, (like the oven for example) for at least an hour or until the dough has doubled in size. 


7.	While the pizza is rising, you can cut the aubergine/eggplant in slices and fry them in a pan filled with olive oil.

8.	Now it's time to roll out the pizza with your rolling pin. 
9.	Keep some more flour next to you and use it on the rolling pin so that the dough won't ruin or make holes.


10.	Choose the tickness according to your taste, then place it on a baking tray. Heat the oven on 180°.


11.	Spread 2-3 table spoons of tomato sauce, few leaves of fresh basil in little pieces, cover all up with mozzarella cheese and place the fried aubergine/eggplant on top. Finally sprinkle with little grated parmesan cheese.


12.	Place in the oven for about 15 minutes, but if you have rolled out the dough quite thin, better to check after 10 minutes.

<Vegetarian Risotto>


--------------------------------------------------------++

Ingredients

--------------------------------------------------------


1 tbsp olive oil

1 onion, chopped

1 parsnip, finely diced

2 medium carrots, finely diced

350g risotto rice, such as arborio

1 bay leaf

1.2l hot vegetable or chicken stock

140g frozen pea or petit pois

50g Parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated


--------------------------------------------------------

Method

--------------------------------------------------------


1.	Heat the oil in a large shallow pan. Tip in the onion, parsnip and carrots, cover and gently fry for 8 mins until the onion is very soft.


2.	Stir in the rice and bay leaf, then gently fry for another 2-3 mins until the rice starts to turn see-through around the edges. 


3.	Add 300ml of the stock and simmer over a gentle heat, stirring until it has all been absorbed. Carry on adding the hot stock, a ladleful at a time, letting it be absorbed before adding more. Continue until the rice is just cooked and all the stock has been used, adding a little more water or stock if needed. This will take 18-20 mins.


4.	Remove the bay leaf from the cooked risotto and stir in the peas. Heat through for a few mins, then add most of the Parmesan and season to taste. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan and serve.
